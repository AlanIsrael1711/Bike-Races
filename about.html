            <p>To quote <a href="https://24hoursofcycling.com/">https://24hoursofcycling.com/</a>: “Mountain biking
                shouldn’t just be for some freaks. Mountain biking should be for all freaks.”</p>

            <p>The Bike Races Series org aspires to organize trials and routes in all the mountains in Europe, available
                to amateur bikers that love travel and adventure.</p>

            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>Bikes, Pedals and Mountains is an organization that promotes trials and routes for amateur bikers in
                different mountains around Europe. We want to organize two big events per year and organize many smaller

                growing our network.</p>
